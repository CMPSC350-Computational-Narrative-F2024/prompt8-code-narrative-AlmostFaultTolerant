## 1. Prompts Used



Write some python code in this file that shows finding new insights when printing results from analysis

Write some python code in this file that shows finding new insights when printing results from analyzing two different lists of numbers

Write some python code in this file that shows finding new insights when printing results from analyzing two different lists of words



## 2. Prompting Strategy

I decided to start of vague with both Copilot and GPT, and found that they both analyzed lists of numbers, even when I didn't provide that specification. I wanted more variety without making it few-shot, so I got more specific on what they should use, first clarifying that they need numbers and second making it be words instead.

## 3. Output Evaluation
TODO:

For each generated code output, consider:
    - Narrative Structure: How does the organization reflect the theme? Is there a clear flow that resembles a narrative?
    - Commentary and Documentation: How do Copilotâ€™s comments contribute to the narrative? Do they add meaning to the code?
    - Design Choices: Evaluate how Copilot's naming conventions, variable usage, and logic choices enhance or detract from the narrative.

### Copilot

### Other Single LLM

## 4. Reflection

TODO: How did your prompt iterations impacted the narrative quality of the generated code? How did Copilot's suggestions supported or hindered the story within the code?
