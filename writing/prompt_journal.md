Write some python code in this file that shows finding new insights when printing results from analyzing two different lists of words



## 2. Prompting Strategy

I decided to start of vague with both Copilot and GPT, and found that they both analyzed lists of numbers, even when I didn't provide that specification. I wanted more variety without making it few-shot, so I got more specific on what they should use, first clarifying that they need numbers and second making it be words instead.

## 3. Output Evaluation

For each generated code output, consider:
    - Narrative Structure: How does the organization reflect the theme? Is there a clear flow that resembles a narrative?
    - Commentary and Documentation: How do Copilotâ€™s comments contribute to the narrative? Do they add meaning to the code?
    - Design Choices: Evaluate how Copilot's naming conventions, variable usage, and logic choices enhance or detract from the narrative.

### Copilot

It seems to get the job done, and while I only used it for generating and not editing existing code, it definetly seems to be useful. I noticed that in terms of code, it uses less comments less flashy print statements than other LLM's like GPT. There is a clear flow though on data analysis and presenting the findings. In terms of naming/variables, copilot seems to name variables what was done to them to creat them. For instance, the variable sorted_numbers was made by, you guessed it, sorting the numbers.

### Other Single LLM

GPT-4 did fine generating code, making the narrative very clear with a lot of descriptive comments and print statements. It did lack narration in terms of variable naming, as it named the initial data as unique_to_a which proves it already concluced analysis by the time this code was generated.

## 4. Reflection

 How did your prompt iterations impacted the narrative quality of the generated code? How did Copilot's suggestions supported or hindered the story within the code? 
I got more descriptive with what I wanted them to analyze which drastically affected the generated code, and in this example copilot helped me more then OpenAI, which I have a lot more experience with.
